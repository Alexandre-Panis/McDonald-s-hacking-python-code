## Description
My first thought about this project was "I wanna eat at McDonalds for free and I will find how to do it", so let's try it.
When you are at McDonald's, you can scan your account barcode into a terminal, so... its possible to log into an account without a password/email/username ?? (and eat free using points of the account)

About barcodes, their are just a 8 lettersnumbers code like "ABCD1234" converted in a simple barcode

So my code is very basic like I just generated "codes" like "ABCD1234" and then converted them in code-128 barcode with this site : https://barcode.tec-it.com/

OK! So we potentially hacked all the McDonald's accounts in the WORLD !! 

Hmm.. Let's talk about probability to generate a valid barcode...
*-> So 26 letters and 10 numbers we have 2,821,109,907,456 barcode possibilities (36^8) 
*-> In France I have estimated there are 4,000,000 accounts so our probability to generated one of them is very very low (0,00014%).
*-> And even if with a lot of chances we manage to connect to an account, the account must contain points ...
